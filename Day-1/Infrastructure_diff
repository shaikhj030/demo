Mutable Infrastructure (Patch-in-place)
---------------------------------------
[ Existing Server ] ---> [ Apply Patch/Update ] ---> [ Same Server, Modified ]
         │
         ├─ Risk: Configuration drift over time
         ├─ Rollback: Complex (undo patches manually)
         └─ Consistency: Hard to guarantee across environments


Immutable Infrastructure (Rebuild & Replace)
--------------------------------------------
[ Existing Server ] ---> [ Build New Image ] ---> [ Deploy New Server ]
         │
         ├─ Old server is discarded, replaced entirely
         ├─ Rollback: Simple (redeploy previous image)
         └─ Consistency: Guaranteed, every server identical
Key Difference
Mutable: You change what’s already running. Over time, servers diverge and become inconsistent.

Immutable: You replace with a fresh copy. Every deployment is clean, reproducible, and easier to roll back.
