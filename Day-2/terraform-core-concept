Summary
Recap of Day‑1: Infrastructure as Code basics, installing Terraform, setting up AWS, creating an EC2 instance, and learning the Terraform lifecycle (init, plan, apply, destroy).

Providers:

Providers act as plugins that let Terraform communicate with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

Types of providers: official (maintained by HashiCorp), partner (maintained by vendors like Alibaba Cloud), and community (open source contributions).

Multi‑Region Setup:

Use provider aliases to deploy resources across multiple AWS regions (e.g., us-east-1 and us-west-2).

Multi‑Cloud Setup:

Configure multiple providers (e.g., AWS and AzureRM) to manage hybrid cloud infrastructure.

Resources:

Resources represent actual infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instance, Azure VM).

Syntax and configuration differ per provider, so documentation is essential.

Variables:

Input variables: Parameterize values like AMI IDs or instance types.

Output variables: Return values such as public IPs after deployment.

TFvars files: Store environment‑specific values (e.g., dev vs prod) for reusability.

Conditional Expressions:

Similar to if/else, used to apply different configurations depending on environment (e.g., enabling public S3 bucket access in dev but disabling in prod).

Built‑in Functions:

Functions like length, map, etc., add flexibility when working with variables and resources.
