Terraform State File:

Acts as Terraform’s “memory,” recording all resources it manages.

Without it, Terraform would re‑create resources instead of updating or deleting them.

Challenges with Local State:

Sensitive data (like passwords or tokens) can be exposed.

Sharing via GitHub or local files risks inconsistency and security issues.

Remote Backends:

Store state securely in external systems (e.g., AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, Azure Storage).

Ensures centralized, consistent, and automatically updated state management.

Demonstration shows configuring S3 as a backend.

State Locking with DynamoDB:

Prevents multiple engineers from applying changes simultaneously.

DynamoDB table is used to lock the state file during operations.

Guarantees consistency and avoids conflicting updates.
