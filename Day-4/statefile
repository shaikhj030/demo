Terraform State File Basics:

The state file records all infrastructure Terraform has created.

It allows Terraform to know whether to update, delete, or create resources instead of duplicating them.

Without it, Terraform would re‑create resources instead of modifying existing ones.

Advantages:

Tracks infrastructure consistently.

Enables updates and deletions safely.

Provides visibility into what Terraform manages.

Drawbacks:

Sensitive data (like passwords or tokens) can be stored in the state file.

Storing state in version control (e.g., GitHub) risks exposure and requires manual updates.

Remote Backend Solution:

Instead of keeping state locally, store it in secure external storage (e.g., AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, Azure Storage).

This ensures centralized, secure, and automatically updated state management.

Demonstration shows configuring S3 as a remote backend.

State Locking with DynamoDB:

Prevents multiple engineers from applying changes simultaneously.

DynamoDB table is used to lock the state file during operations.

Ensures consistency and avoids conflicting updates.
