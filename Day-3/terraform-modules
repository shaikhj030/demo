Monolithic Project
------------------
[ main.tf ]
   ├─ EC2 resources
   ├─ VPC resources
   ├─ S3 resources
   ├─ EKS cluster
   └─ All tangled together

Problems:
- Hard to debug
- No clear ownership
- Difficult to scale
- Risk of errors when multiple people edit


Modular Project
---------------
[ Root Configuration ]
   ├─ module "ec2_instance"
   ├─ module "vpc"
   ├─ module "s3"
   └─ module "eks"

Each module:
   • Has its own main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf
   • Can be reused across projects
   • Easier to maintain and test
   • Clear ownership and accountability

Key Takeaway
Monolithic = one giant file, messy and hard to manage.

Modular = clean, reusable building blocks, just like microservices in software engineering.

This is exactly what the video emphasizes: breaking infrastructure into modules makes Terraform projects scalable, maintainable, and collaborative.
